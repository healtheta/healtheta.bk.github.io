# Getting Started

HealTheta helps you to create health care applications and enables interoperability between various healthcare systems using FHIR API standard. It is believed that the future of healthcare applications will interface using fast health care interoperability resources. FHIR standardizes a RESTful interface for hundreds of clinical objects spanning Patients, Claims, Providers, Medications, etc. On top of this, HealTheta enables apps to plug into hundreds of health system locations using OAuth2 and EHR standards, so teams can embed their app within the EHR and authorize access to patient data. Typical standardization of this technology involves many facets including data structure, version tracking, methods of autorization, search APIs. Additionally HealTheta enables FHIR provenance on blockchain based ledger technology. HealTheta's purpose and objective is to help app developers a jump start by providing all functionalties such as, data storage, Application Programming Interfaces, Privacy and Security so the team can focus on adding value to their end product,

## Why Use HealTheta ?
HealTheta's vision of substitutable healthcare applications holds many benefits for app developers, healthcare providers, patients, healthcare institutions and public health, Those are,

### Health Care Providers
- Apps empower users, rather than only technology vendors or government committees, to decide which health IT products are beneficial and valuable
- Add new capabilities to existing systems, for example to visualize risks, trends, and trajectories
- Integrate new data into systems, mashing up clinical records with external data sources and incorporating new flows of data from sensors, devices, and patient reports

### Health Care Institutions
- Improve return on EHR investment by streamlining internal EHR customization projects
- Simplify the integration of best of breed components into existing systems
- Ability to easily draw on a library of innovate apps encourages market competition on quality, cost, and usability

### Public Health
- Apps can transfer ideas, functionality, and workflow all in one package â€“ a good app, distributed widely, could reshape practice overnight
- Decision support can be updated without the need to customize for each EHR, supporting rapid response during outbreaks and as guidelines change
