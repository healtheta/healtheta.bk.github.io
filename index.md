# Getting Started

HealTheta helps you to create health care applications and enables interoperability between various healthcare systems using FHIR API standard. It is believed that the future of healthcare applications will interface using fast health care interoperability resources. FHIR standardizes a RESTful interface for hundreds of clinical objects spanning Patients, Claims, Providers, Medications, etc. On top of this, HealTheta enables apps to plug into hundreds of health system locations using OAuth2 and EHR standards, so teams can embed their app within the EHR and authorize access to patient data. Typical standardization of this technology involves many facets including data structure, version tracking, methods of autorization, search APIs. Additionally HealTheta enables FHIR provenance on blockchain based ledger technology. HealTheta's purpose and objective is to help app developers a jump start by providing all functionalties such as, data storage, Application Programming Interfaces, Privacy and Security so the team can focus on adding value to their end product,

## Anatomy

Healtheta gives you FHIR data storage with the power of SQ or NoSQL, RESTful FHIR APIs, an API Gateway, Privacy and Security Platform with irreversible block-chain based transaction/audit ledger. Healtheta also provides reference application implementation to ease the commitment of application developers.
