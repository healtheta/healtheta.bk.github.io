### FHIP Core
FHIP Core is built on the notion of picoservices; We would like to take pride in introducing the concept of picoservices on top of microservices architecutre. This enables us to intrdoduce fine grained security and analytical feature in-built from ground up of the design process. 

### Edge Gateway
If your system consists of multiple services, you can use a unified access layer to manage security and routing between them.

### Consent Directive Management 
Our Consent Directive Management Solution enables patients  to determine through an online secure consent process, which health information they would like to share and not share with their primary and speciality health care providers. This has been developed keeping following in mind,
- Able to make meaningful choices to share their protected behavioral healthcare information
- Confirms to standards and procedures practiced throughout the world
- Give control of health information exchange in the hands of the person who has the right to decide who can access his/her data 

### Security And Access Control
OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect and flexible security rules to control user access to healthcare application data.
