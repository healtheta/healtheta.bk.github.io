## Resource Server
Resource server is built on the notion of picoservices; We would like to take pride in introducing the concept of picoservices on top of microservices architecutre. The fine-grained granularity in controlling each services at a pico-service architecture enables our solution to be one of the fore-front runners in implementing in-built security at an indivudual API level. The resource server is composed of following parts

### Edge-Server Gateway
If your system consists of multiple services, you can use a unified access layer to manage security and routing between them.
